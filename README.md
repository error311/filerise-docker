## changelog

## changes 3/8/2025

- Validation was added in endpoints.
- Toast notifications were implemented in domUtils.js and integrated throughout the app.
- Modals replaced inline prompts and confirms for rename, create, delete, copy, and move actions.
- Folder tree UI was added and improved to be interactive plus reflect the current state after actions.

## changes 3/7/2025

- **Module Refactoring:**
  - Split the original `utils.js` into multiple ES6 modules for network requests, DOM utilities, file management, folder management, uploads, and authentication.
  - Converted all code to ES6 modules with `import`/`export` syntax and exposed necessary functions globally.
- **File List Rendering & Pagination:**
  - Implemented pagination in `fileManager.js` to allow displaying 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page.
  - Added global functions (`changePage` and `changeItemsPerPage`) for pagination control.
  - Added a pagination control section below the file list table.
- **Date Sorting Enhancements:**
  - Created a custom date parser (`parseCustomDate`) to convert date strings.
  - Adjusted the parser to handle two-digit years by adding 2000.
  - Integrated the parser into the sorting function to reliably sort “Date Modified” and “Upload Date” columns.
- **File Upload Improvements:**
  - Enabled multi-file uploads with individual progress tracking (visible for the first 10 files).
  - Ensured that the file list refreshes immediately after uploads complete.
  - Kept the upload progress list visible for a configurable delay to allow users to verify upload success.
  - Reattached event listeners after the file list is re-rendered.
- **File Action Buttons:**
  - Unified button state management so that Delete, Copy, and Move buttons remain visible as long as files exist, and are only enabled when files are selected.
  - Modified the logic in `updateFileActionButtons` and removed conflicting code from `initFileActions`.
  - Ensured that the folder dropdown for copy/move is hidden when no files exist.
- **Rename Functionality:**
  - Added a “Rename” button to the Actions column for every file.
  - Implemented a `renameFile` function that prompts for a new name, calls a backend script (`renameFile.php`) to perform the rename, updates metadata, and refreshes the file list.
- **Responsive & UI Tweaks:**
  - Applied CSS media queries to hide secondary columns on small screens.
  - Adjusted file preview and icon styling for better alignment.
  - Centered the header and optimized the layout for a clean, modern appearance.
  
*This changelog and feature summary reflect the improvements made during the refactor from a monolithic utils file to modular ES6 components, along with enhancements in UI responsiveness, sorting, file uploads, and file management operations.*
